<div id="divht1"><h4 id="homet1">This entire web-site is about me! I know right, crazy! If you are here to see whether or not I have what it takes to design, and maintain your websites, you have come to the right place! This page <a href="home.html">Home</a> is all about me, my story. I think knowing who you are working with, is just as important as experience.</a></h4></div>
<div id="divht2"><h5 id=homet2>I started my career in Retail at 17 years old, absolutely loving Customer Service and coming out of my shy high-school selfs shell. I become a Shift Manager at Mcdonalds at Only 19. After doing this for a year, I proceeded to look for a different form of retail, for more experience. So I started working at a Surf/Skate fashion store and jumped right into Shift Management again. I loved this, but I always had the desire to work somewhere in the IT field, in school I did film, tv and new media, but these classes mostly consisted of me messing around with the IT equipment, computers ETC. I proceeded into building my own computers which I found really fun and exciting. I started researching and came across Web-Development. I seemingly fun job, with loads of benefits which include but are not limited to, a great work-life balanced lifestyle, and the absolutely awesome paycheck! I currently am proficient in basic HTML, CCS3, and have recently started learning the basics of GitHub. Unfortunetly, working full-time, and studying whilst also not having family to help me, it is a struggle, and I wont stop studying in my spare time until I reach my goals! I am now studying the advanced side of HTML. While I am learning, I am learning fast. Hiring me would 100% be a huge investment in your company. Provided I am equiped with training with MylearningPeople as well as your company as well! I am very loyal, provided I am treated as an equal. </h5></div>
